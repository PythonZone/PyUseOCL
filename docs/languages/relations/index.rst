RelationScript
--------------

RelationScript allows to express "schemas_" in the sense of the
`relational data model`_.

.. note::
    Note that the term "relation model" should not
    be confused with "relational data model". A relation model defines
    relations, just like usecase models defines usecases, class models
    defines classes, object models defines objects, and so on.

Concepts
--------

RelationScript is based on the following concepts:

* schema (called relation model),
* relations,
* columns,
* key and foreign keys,
* constraints on domains,
* functional dependencies.
* normal forms,
* datasets,
* queries.

Relations
---------

Declaration of relations can expressed in a single line using the simple
notation typically used in textbooks. Column names are separated
by commas. While key attributes, usually underlined in textbooks,
are here enclosed in underscores such as ``_a_``).

::

    R3(_a_,_b_,c,d)

In the example above the column ``a`` and ``b`` are key participants.
This means that there are part of some key, but there is no indication
of what are the keys. This could be a key (a,b), or two keys (a) and (b).
If necessary the body of the relation will define what are the keys.

Relation intention
------------------

The intention of a relation can be defined informally somehow inside the
documentation of the relation.

::

    relation R4(_a_,c,d)
        | The list of X with their c and d.
        | In this relation the person a is ... with c ... and d ...

It can also be defined for "formally" in the intention section.

::

    relation R4(_a_,c,d)
        | The list of X with their c and d.
        intention
            (a,c,d) in R4 <=>
            | the person a is ... with c ... and d ...



Constraints on domain
---------------------

The domain of the attributes can be defined as following.

::

    relation R(a,b,c,d)
        constraints
            dom(a) = String
            dom(b) = dom(c) = Date
            dom(d) = Real ?

A basic type followed by '?' means that this domain is extended
with the ``null value`` ; the corresponding attribute is optional.

RelationalScript come with various datatype. Each datatype comes with
a shortcut notations that can be helpful when writing relation on a
single line.

=============== ==============
Datatype        Shortcut
=============== ==============
String          s
Real            r
Boolean         b
Integer         i
Date            d
DateTime        dt
Time            s
=============== ==============



Integrity constraints
---------------------

Integrity constraint, and in particular `Referential integrity constraints`_,
can be named or anonymous. They can be defined using plain text or using
the `relational algebra`_ notation when applicable.

::

    constraint Parent
        | Les parents d'une personne doivent être
        | plus agés que cette personne, d'au moins 7 ans.

    constraint FK_34h
        | The h of the relation R3 is one of the h of R4.
        R3[h] C= R4[h]

    constraints
        R1[d] C= R2[d]
        R1[d1,d1] C= R2[d1,d2]
        R[X] u R[z] = {}
        R[X] n R[z] = Persons[X]

See `relational algebra`_ section for more details about the notation.

Functional dependencies
-----------------------

`Functional dependencies`_ and the associated concepts can be defined as
following:

::

    relation R(a,b,c,d)
        constraints
            key a,b
            a,b -> c,d
            prime a
            prime b
            /prime c
            a -/> c
            c -ffd> d
            a -/ffd> b
            {a}+ = {a,b,c}


Normal forms
------------

::

    relation R(a,b,c,d)
        constraints
            3NF

Transformations
---------------

::

    import quality model Database from `../qa/database.qas`

    relation R(a,b,c,d)
        transformation
            from C1
            from C2
            rules R1
            | Columns C1.c and Columns C2.c
            | have been "merged" as following ...


Queries
-------

::

    query Q1(boss)
        | The department leaders
        (Employe:(firstname='John')[department] * Leaders)[boss]

Queries are based on the `relational algebra section`_.

Relational algebra
------------------

In RelationScript all classical operators of the relational algebra
(`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra>`_)
have their counterparts in ascii syntax.

==================  ====================================================
Operator            Example
==================  ====================================================
Projection          Employee[salary]
Selection           Employee :( address='Randwick' )
Renaming            L(employee, address) := Employee[firstname, address]
Cartesian product   Employee x Leaders
θ join              Employee * ( Employee.dept=Leaders.dept ) Leaders
Natural join        Employee * Leaders
Union               Employee[firstname] u Leaders[firstname]
Intersection        Employee[firstname] n Leaders[firstname]
Difference          Employee[firstname] - Leaders[firstname]
Empty set           {}
Set inclusion       Employee C= Person
Set inclusion       Employee C Person
Set equality        Employee = Person
Intersection        Employee n Person
Union               Employee u Person
Tuple               (10, 3, 'Hello)
