"""
Model elements resulting from the evaluation of a story.
The global structure of this metamodel package is as following::

    StepEvaluation
    --->1 Step (step)
    --->* Access
    --->* Issue
    <--->0..1 StepEvaluation (parent)

    StepEvaluation
    <|-- CompositeStepEvaluation
        <>--* StepEvaluation (stepEvaluations)
        <|-- StoryEvaluation
            ----1 ObjectModel (finalState)
    <|-- OperationStepEvaluation  (see "operations" package)


The evaluation hierarchy goes in "parallel" with the step
hierarchy, with the same parent relationship but in parallel.
