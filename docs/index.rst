PyUseOCL is mostly intended forautomation. PyUseOCL also provides a few features out of the boxvia the a very simple command line...  toctree::    :maxdepth: 8    features    quickStart    cli    apiReferences==========*   :ref:`genindex`*   :ref:`modindex`..  _`USE OCL`: http://sourceforge.net/projects/useocl/..  _OCL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Constraint_Language..  _UML: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language..  _OCL specification: http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/..  _`ScribesTools/UseOCL`:    http://scribestools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/useocl/index.html
