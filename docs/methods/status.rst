Status
======

A status report have to be written down for each model or WorkDefinition.
In order to do so a file ``status.md`` is associated to each model,
or to a group of models. There is as well a global ``status.md`` file
at the top level directory.

Rules
-----

The following information should be present in the status file:

* what have been done,
* what is partially working and have to be continued / improved,
* what remains to be done.,
* a short synthesis.

Add other information when necessary (for instance bug found or
issues encountered during the realisation of the task, a reference
to an important hypothesis).

Be concise, yet as structured as possible.

If everything is ok, then a simple message could be enough. If some
parts remain to be done an indicator such as "(about) 25% done" can be
helpful. If the task has subtasks this could be "T3: Shape,
Rectangle, Circle to be implemented".

**Be concise, yet as structured as possible.**
