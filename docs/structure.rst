resulting from the execution of the scenario. This is an
"object diagram" in terms of UML. This object diagram

The end state of the scenario is represented with two files.

* "scenario-end.olt", the layout saved by USE OCL
* "scenario-end.scd.png", an image created using a screen shot of the diagram
