    Generates all possible paths between a node and another.
    list(genPaths(g,'a','c')) could be like  [[b],[b,c]].
    This is a generator, so it does not return directly a list.

    function that give a list of successors for a given node.
    The function must be defined for all nodes.
    This function could serve to identify cycles.
