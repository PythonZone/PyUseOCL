    description

        | To be used where appropriate.
    goal
        | This section describes the goals of the actor(s).
        | What they try to acheive by performing the usecase.
        | This section is useful to make sure that the usecase
        | has a real business value. So-called "essential
        | usecases" are based on this information.
    precondition
        | The condition that is necessary for the usecase to
        | be performed. When the condition is satisfied the
        | usecase could be executed, but only if the "trigger"
        | (see below) is activated
    trigger
        | The event that make the usecase start.
    postcondition
        | The condition that is satisfied at the end of the
        | execution of the usecase.
    risk: low
        | The risk associated with the implementation of the
        | usecase.
    frequency
        | The estimate about the usecase frequency.
        | This could be for instance "twice a year", "10 per hour".
    volume
        | The estimate about the volume of data to be processed
        | for example. This could be something like '100 units to
        | be created in average".
    flow
        | The flow of events describing the "nominal flow",
        | that is the most important/common scenario.
        | The flow should be defined as a sequence of step,
        | each step being prefixed by a number between parenthesis.
        | For instance:
        |
        | (1) first step.
        | (2) second step. The description of this step does not fit
        |     in one line so it is indented.
        |     Yet another line in the description of step (2).
        | (3) third step
        | ...
        |
    extension EmployeeAlreadyDefined at step 2
        when
            | When this condition is satisfied in step 2 of the normal
            | flow then this extension is executed.
        flow
            | The alternate flow for this extension.
            | (1) step 1 for this extension.
            | ...
            | (n) return to CreateDepartment.4
