"""
Model elements resulting from the evaluation of a story.
Each step evaluation is associated with a step but
it additionally have :
    * a list of issues that the evaluation raise for this step
    * a list of accesses made by the step.

While steps are syntactical elements and have various elements
unbound (e.g. ('x', A, 'y')) these elements are bound in
evaluation steps (e.g. x and y have been resolved). However, the
result of the binding for each step is not stored however because:
    * this avoid to have a evaluation class for each step class
      (e.g. ObjectCreation -> ObjectCreationEvaluation),
    * the binding itself is not so important,
    * what is important is the result of the step evaluation.

Instead of having specialized step evaluation for each step
(e.g. ObjectCreationEvaluation) a generic StepEvaluation is used.

The global structure of this metamodel package is as following::

    StepEvaluation
    --->1 Step (step)
    --->* Access
    --->* Issue
    <---> 0..1 CompositeStepEvaluation (parent)

    StepEvaluation
    <|-- CompositeStepEvaluation
        <>--* StepEvaluation (stepEvaluations)
        <|-- StoryEvaluation
            ----1 ObjectModel (finalState)
    <|-- IncludeEvaluation
        ----1 Story
    <|-- OperationStepEvaluation  (see "operations" package)


The evaluation hierarchy goes in "parallel" with the step
hierarchy, with the same parent relationship but in parallel.
There is simplfy less-typed nodes, one unique type for all operation
steps.
