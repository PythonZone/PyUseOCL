Status
======

A status report have to be writen down for each model or WorkDefinition.
A files ``status.rst`` is associated to each model, or to a group of
models.

The following information should be present in the status file:

* what have been done
* what is partially working and have to be continued / improved
* what has not be done

Add other information when necessary (for instance bug found or
issues encountered during the realisation of the task).

Be concise, yet as structured as possible.

If everything is ok, then one could be enough. If some parts remain
to be done an indicator such as "(about) 25% done". If the task has
subtasks this could be "T3: Shape, Rectangle, Circle to be implemented".

** Be concise, yet as structured as possible. **
