"""
Metamodel package representing the evaluation of operations.
This goes with the package "stories.evaluation".

The evaluation of operations is not detailled.
That is, there is no one class for all operation evaluation.

This simplification avoids repeating the hierarchy of
Operation class, with only few additional information.

For instance instead of keeping for the deletion of an
object, the reference to this object (which depends on
the evaluation), a generic OperationStepEvaluation is
used instead.

This strategy is good enough since the details
of the evaluation of each operation is not so important.
What is important is the evaluation of "check" operations as well
ast the final state (stored in the StoryEvaluation).
