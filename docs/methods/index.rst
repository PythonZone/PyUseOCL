=======

ModelScript supports different "methods" with different learning
objectives. Each method on a project layout, with

*   a **directory layout** defining name of each directory as well as the
    content of these directories, including in most cases the name
    of the file.

*   a series of tasks to be performed in a sequential order or in an
    iterative way. Each tasks define what todo, input artefacts and
    output artefacts.
